# INLY

INLY is a self-hosted note-taking app designed with security in mind. It gives you full control over your data with strong encryption and allows for easy collaboration within your team. The idea is to create a note-taking experience you can trust, without relying on third-party services.

## Study Case

I've used quite a few note-taking apps over the years, and honestly, I’ve never fully trusted any of them. They either didn’t respect privacy, had terrible security, or just didn’t let me have the level of control I wanted. 

So, I decided to build INLY. The goal? To create a note-taking system that I can trust, that can be self-hosted, and most importantly, to make it easy for me to collaborate with my team. We needed something secure, private, and simple to use. INLY was born from that need — a tool that gives you full control and ensures that your data stays safe.

## Features

- **Security**: End-to-end encryption to protect your notes, ensuring only you (and those you choose) have access.
- **Self-hosting**: Host it on your own server, putting you in charge of your data.
- **Collaboration**: Work with your team through customizable access controls.
- **Minimal Design**: Focus on what matters — your notes — with a clean, simple interface.
